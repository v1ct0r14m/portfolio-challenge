# portfolio-challenge

In this challenge, we were told to create a portfolio for apps and such to be displayed and reviewed by future employers.
Utilizing the skills retained from the class thus far, I created a webpage that can hold as a personal site where others can view
various works. The html and the css cooperation was particularly hard to figure out, as there are three anchor dots for my unlisted
items that will not disappear, along with difficulty assembling and piecing together the page itself with the images. I hope to
learn a lot from the feedback recieved from this challenge, as it would be extremely helpful.
